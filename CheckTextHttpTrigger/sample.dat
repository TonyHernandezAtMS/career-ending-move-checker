    "text": "Hey people, We were thinking of changing a few things around the office. These things have bothered most of us and the management thinks it is time we take notice of these aspects. I know that we are all real busy but we should speak about these points in our next meeting. Also, many have not yet submitted the reports and the deadline is coming up in the next couple of days. So, make sure we all concentrate. Thanks, Benny Markos."
